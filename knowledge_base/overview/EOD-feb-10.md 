End-of-Day Report: Agent-Forge Project Progress (February 10, 2026)
Prepared by: Grok (Senior Architect & Project Manager)

Eric, today was focused entirely on preparing and refining the **AiderDesk Capability Baseline Spike** (the precursor evaluation before Epic 3). The day consisted of gathering the full Epic 1 artifact set (status doc + all four PRDs), finalizing the spike structure, addressing Junie’s detailed feedback, and resolving blockers so the evaluation can start tomorrow.

This report captures the full context of the day’s conversations, decisions, artifacts, feedback loop, and current state — written for maximum RAG fidelity rather than brevity.

### 1. Full Context of Today’s Work
The day began with you providing the complete Epic 1 reference package:

- **Epic 1 Implementation Status & Readiness** (the master overview doc dated 2026-01-25)
- **Epic 1 Atomic PRD Index**
- **PRD 1.1** – Database Schema (6 models, associations, validations, full RSpec model specs, factories, schema checks)
- **PRD 1.2** – Prefab HTTP Client Service (HTTParty client, error handling, URL encoding, WebMock specs)
- **PRD 1.3** – HomeKit Sync Service & Rake Task (orchestration, idempotency, many-to-many sync, deep integration tests)
- **PRD 1.4** – Webhook Endpoint (controller, auth, payload parsing, request specs, CSRF bypass)

These documents were shared sequentially so we could use them as the gold-standard template for the spike task prompt and evaluation criteria.

### 2. Spike Design & Scope Decisions
After reviewing all four PRDs, we selected **PRD 1.2 (Prefab HTTP Client Service)** as the evaluation task for the following reasons (captured for future reference):

- Self-contained → one service file + one spec file
- Realistic Rails service-layer work (API client, resilience, config, strong mocking/testing)
- No dependency on models/migrations (unlike 1.3 or 1.4)
- High diagnostic value → tests URL encoding, logging, error handling, ENV config, WebMock usage
- Matches our common pattern → service + comprehensive RSpec with contexts for success/failure/edge cases

Scope adjustments:
- Required: homes, rooms, accessories, scenes methods
- Optional bonus: accessory_details
- Explicit emphasis on URL encoding (special characters test)
- Full WebMock coverage for failures, timeouts, non-200, ENV override
- Rails 8+ idioms, logging on error, custom ConnectionError class

### 3. Spike Structure Finalized
We built the spike in full Epic/PRD format to streamline handoff to Junie:

- **Spike Epic document** (overview, goals, success criteria, order, dependencies)
- **Spike PRD Index** (S.1, S.2, S.3)
- **PRD S.1**: Project Setup (eureka-homekit-rebuild prep, worktrees, gems, AiderDesk start)
- **PRD S.2**: Evaluation Execution (run 3–4 configs: Claude focused, Claude agent, Ollama focused, Grok optional)
- **PRD S.3**: Results Analysis (per-config report + final summary insights)

All content lives in one consolidated file for this spike (no separate files yet — keeps overhead low).

### 4. Junie Feedback Loop & Blockers Resolved
Junie provided detailed feedback on the spike docs (version V1):

- **Document discrepancies** → index listed separate files that didn’t exist
  → Decision: Keep everything in one file (`0000-epic-3-spike.md`) for this spike; updated guidance accordingly

- **Missing PrefabClient task prompt** → blocker
  → Resolved: Full prompt text provided (exact copy-paste version for AiderDesk)

- **Naming confusion from old PRD copy-paste** → PRD-1-01 vs 1-02 feedback naming
  → Clarified: Use `0000-epic-3-spike-feedback-V{{N}}.md` (your V1 is correct)

- **Intervention protocol ambiguous** → “truly stuck” not defined
  → Updated: 3× same question, 5 min no output, explicit “I cannot proceed”, obvious hallucination

- **Reporting enhancements** → suggested adding hallucinations metric
  → Adopted: Now tracking hallucinations/deviations explicitly in reports

All blockers cleared → Junie is now cleared to start PRD S.1 tomorrow.

### 5. Current State & Hand-off Readiness
- **Spike Epic & PRDs** → fully written and refined
- **Task prompt** → complete and ready for copy-paste into AiderDesk
- **Junie summary** → delivered with updated intervention & reporting rules
- **Project** → eureka-homekit-rebuild in `projects/` → confirmed accessible
- **AiderDesk** → expected to be running on `localhost:24337` (admin:booberry)

### 6. Key Decisions & Rationale Captured
- Why PRD 1.2 over others → highest signal-to-noise for service-layer evaluation
- Why single-file spike → minimize friction for short evaluation
- Why passive observation → want to see AiderDesk’s natural behavior
- Why 3–4 configs → balance coverage vs time (Claude focused = primary)

### 7. Tomorrow’s Immediate Next Steps
- Junie executes PRD S.1 (setup + worktree creation)
- Then begins PRD S.2 starting with Config 1 (Claude focused mode)
- Logs pauses, interventions, test results per run
- Produces per-config report + final summary

### 8. Risks & Open Questions
- Risk: AiderDesk not reachable → Junie will report immediately
- Risk: Ollama model performance → fallback to Claude if needed
- Open: Do we want to force accessory_details method as required? (currently optional)

**grok_eric:** Let me know tonight or first thing tomorrow if you want any last tweaks (e.g. make accessory_details required, add another metric, change model priority). Otherwise Junie is fully cleared to start PRD S.1 in the morning.

Sleep well — this spike is going to give us exactly the data we need before diving into Epic 3 RAG. 🚀

Note from eric: we had extensive issues getting Ollama to work correctly we trouble shot the issue ( which was caused by interactive prompts ) we are still working on a resolion to correct the issue
