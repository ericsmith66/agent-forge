- Maintain existing boundaries and layering; do not move responsibilities unless required.
- When extracting services, keep call sites and inputs stable.
- Add instrumentation where missing, without changing user-visible behavior.
- Ensure refactors preserve authorization and auditing flows.
- Keep operational concerns (caching, jobs, metrics) consistent with existing patterns.
