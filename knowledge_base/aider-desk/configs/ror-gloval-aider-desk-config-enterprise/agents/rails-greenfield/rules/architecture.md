- Follow a layered flow: controllers → services → models/queries.
- Isolate external integrations in `app/clients` or `app/services` with clear boundaries.
- Keep write operations inside explicit transactions when multiple records are touched.
- Prefer feature flags for risky or phased rollouts.
- Add background jobs for long-running or retryable work.
- Add observability hooks (logging/metrics) for new critical paths.
